This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error when iterating over a std::vector. The bug.cpp file shows the incorrect code, leading to accessing memory beyond the vector's bounds.  The bugSolution.cpp file provides the corrected code.  This example highlights the importance of careful indexing when working with arrays and vectors in C++ to prevent unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
